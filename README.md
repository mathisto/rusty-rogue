# Hullo, Singularity6!

I heard y'all are a Rust shop. I've toyed around before but never made anything of substance. Here is to learnin' a bit o' Rust with this deliciously polished [roguelike tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_1.html). This seemed too perfect an opportunity to learn how you witches and warlocks in gamedevland manage to do *so much* in 1/60th a second. Even more interesting, I've never used an ECS and it looks like a really interesting technique for managing complexity.

I'll keep good commit hygeine so you can easily read the log for a high level overview of the process I went through. I'll make sure to preserve any mistakes I make in the commits along with the lesson learned.
